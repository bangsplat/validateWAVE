Description

Perl script to analyze a WAVE file and validate that it is a proper WAVE file.

Outputs information about the file, as well as any warnings or errors.


Usage

$ perl validateWAVE.pl <input.wav>

Works with glob operations (i.e., validateWAVE.pl *.wav) to operate on multiple WAVE files.


Output

Outputs to stdio.  Can be piped to a text file or command line utility like grep.


Known Issues

None, though I have not tested with many faulty WAVE files, so there may be some issues with oddball cases.
